# React Learning Projects

This repository contains my first React practice projects as I start my journey of learning React.js.  
Right now, I have created only one small project — a simple Card UI — and I will keep adding more as I learn.

## 📘 Current Project

### 1. Card UI Component
My first React mini-project where I built a reusable Card component to understand:

- JSX basics  
- Props  
- Component structure  
- Styling in React  
- Reusable UI design  

This project helped me learn how components work and how to create clean UI elements.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

I created this repo to track my progress while learning React, including:

- How components work  
- Props & state  
- Basic UI building  
- Folder structure and project setup  
- Creating reusable components  

More projects will be added as I learn new concepts.
